# Introduction
I will analyze the data to answer the following questions about UFO sightings:
1. Do they occur more in the daytime or nightime?
2. Is it seasonal?
3. Are there trends over time?
4. What are the most common UFO descriptions? 
5. Where are the hotspots?
6. Are there certain landmarks that are hotspots, such as airports or government research centers? 

# Data Source
The sightings are from the National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) which was acquired by Sigmond Axel and can be found at https://github.com/planetsig/ufo-reports. I downloaded it as a .csv file.  

NUFORC allows the use of the data for non-commericial uses. There is a caveat on the website that states: "The National UFO Reporting Center makes no claims as to the validity of the information in any of these reports. Obvious hoaxes have been omitted, however most reports have been posted exactly as received in the authorâ€™s own words." The NUFORC website address is https://nuforc.org/.


# Data Exploration
There are 88,876 records and 11 variables. All variables are useable but some need extensive cleaning.

# Data Cleaning
Variable names duration (seconds), duration (hours/min), and date posted are unrecognized when performing SQL queries. The names duration (seconds) and duration (hours/min) were changed to duration_sec, duration_hour_min, and date_posted.
- Remove leading and trailing spaces.
- Remove duplicate records.
- Remove null values in industry, education, gender, and race variables.
- Change strings to upper case.
- Remove punctuation marks.
- Change the datatype of annual_salary to an integer.

## Filtering
**Age**  
The age for earning an annual salary can be assumed to apply only to adults, so remove records 

## New Variables
Records with a currency other than U.S. dollars must be converted to U.S. dollars for a
