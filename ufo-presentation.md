# Observations
1. Sightings have increased at a much faster rate than the population has.
2. There is more activity after sundown.
3. Descriptions have two clusters; it can be a light in the sky or the shape of the ship can be seen.
4. The largest number of sightings were in cities, states and provinces with the largest populations.

# Conclusion
UFO sightings have increased at an astounding rate since 1930. Over this same period, media of all kinds has focused a lot on science fiction and aliens with ever-increasing frequency. Combined with the ability to share personal opinions with a large audience via social media helps explain this phenomina.

The sightings peak between 8pm and 11pm, but after most people go to bed it is still dark enough to see UFOs for another 6 to 7 hours. That throws some suspicion on the validity of the sightings.

No "hotspots" exist; instead the frequency of sightings grows in proportion to the popluation size where sighting occurred.
