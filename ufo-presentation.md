# Observations
1. Sightings have increased much faster than the population has grown over the same period.
2. Activity is greatest between 8pm and 11pm.
3. Descriptions have two clusters: a light in the sky or the ship's shape is apparent.
4. Sightings were highest in cities and states with the largest populations.

# Conclusion
UFO sightings have increased at an astounding rate since 1930. Over this same period, media of all kinds focused on science fiction and aliens increased as well. The ability to share personal opinions with a large audience via social media helps explain this phenomenon.

The sightings peak between 8pm and 11pm. But after most people go to bed, it is still dark enough to see UFOs for another 6 to 7 hours, which raises some suspicion about the validity of the sightings.

No "hotspots" exist; instead, the frequency of sightings grows in proportion to the population size where the sighting occurred.
