# Observations
1. Sightings have increased at a much faster rate than the population has.
2. There is more activity after sundown.
3. Descriptions have two clusters; it can be a light in the sky or the shape of the ship can be seen.
4. The largest number of sightings were in cities, states and provinces with the largest populations.

# Conclusion
UFO sightings have increased at an astounding rate over the decades. Over this same period, media of all kinds has focused a lot on science fiction and aliens with ever-increasing frequency. Combined with the ability to share personal opinions with a large audience via social media helps explain this phenomina.

No "hotspots" exist; instead the frequency of sightings grows in proportion to the popluation size of the sighting locations.
